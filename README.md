# xray-classification
Chest X-ray classification using YOLOv8n trained on custom dataset with Roboflow and Google Colab. Classifies Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases.

This project uses the YOLOv8n classification model trained on a custom chest X-ray dataset to categorize images into Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 classes. It processes X-ray images to identify key features related to these conditions, enabling efficient and accurate medical image classification. The model can make predictions on individual images and provide classification probabilities for each class.
